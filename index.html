      <p>  ceLoot represents a basic set of traits of character on the Celo networküî¶. It is the beginning of the D'n'D metaverse. New traits can be earned, won, or bought. ceLoot will contain a more advanced set of traits after interactions with other contracts.</p>
      <p>  Our project team is fan of Dungeons and Dragons, at the same times, we also a loyal fan of the crypto world. So, why not combine the above two?</p>
      <p>  Yes, we are doing this. Thanks to the inspiration of the Loot project, we hope to build a decentralized world of Dungeons and Dragons, where we can freely communicate, explore, trade and display.</p>
      <p>  When we experienced the expensive cost of the ETH chain and the traffic congestion of MAITC, we finally discovered Celo, a mobile-first platform that allows anyone to access dApps and encrypted payments via mobile phones, which is exactly what we want. Connect to the decentralized network anytime, anywhere, and start a great adventure with sword and magic!</p>
      <p>  5555 ceLoot (5000 for public, rest for airdrop and community rewards). No chasing IDs. Everyone has equal opportunities. Just choose how many tokens to mint. All funds are going to project development and rewards for the community.</p>
      <p>  Contrary to projects like Loot, ceLoot allows expanding imagination in MORE game cases. People like to play or associate themself not only with the fairytale world but also with the world of money-making or development.</p>
      <p>  There will be many projects using the underlying contract. Users can create their own stories, interpret characters according to their traits. We look forward to cooperating with more projects and building Metaverse together.</p>
      <p>Mint up to 10 ceLoot in one transaction! (Price: 1 Celo, 1 ceLoot.)</p>
